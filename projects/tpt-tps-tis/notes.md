## Approximate reaction coordinates
We want to write down reaction coordinates before we spend any time simulating the system. How can we do this?
- If we can somehow "span the slow subspace" of configurations likely to be encountered, using some method to enumerate low-energy states e.g. potential smoothing or K* search, then we can compute RCs for these conformations and bias the dynamics along these coordinates.

## Online learning
This seems similar to an online learning

## Structural SVM

## SVMs for transition-interface identification

## Folding coordinates from evolutionary pressure
- In e.g. [Reaction coordinates and rates from transition paths](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/19/6732) Fig. 2, reaction coordinates as a function of native contacts are represented by residue-residue contact matrices-- project the contact matrix onto an arbitrary weight matrix to yield a reaction coordinate: goal: find a weight matrix that corresponds to a good reaction coordinate
- In evofold, for example, we can infer likely native contacts from evolutionary history-- can this prior information be used when selecting the weight matrix?

### 1. Introduction
- Reaction coordinates:
  - global coordinates that help us understand how the system proceeds from one state to the other
  - ideally, interpretable
  - ideally, linked to reaction mechanism
  - Uses:
    - qualitative model of atomic motion
    - reaction rate calculation
    - visualizing reaction progress
    - interpret molecular simulations after exhaustive sampling has been obtained
    - enhance sampling of configurational space relevant to the reaction of interest
- Order parameter:
  - rough variable: gauge progress of reaction
- Reaction coordinate:
  - collective coordinate that can be used for rate calculations

- Model macromolecular dynamics as overdamped diffusion: when free energy as a function of RCs is available, can use Kramers' reaction-rate theory to extract reaction rate and mechanism

- Enhanced sampling: example: in a system with a large separation of timescales, with long-timescale dynamics dominated by a single rare event, a free energy map could be calculated more efficiently if we knew the reaction coordinate and sampled along it directly

- Chicken-and-egg problem: after an equilibrium sampling is available, it is possible to define RCs and test their validity a posteriori

### 2. Intuition-based coordinates and the isocommittor
- Simple systems permit physically intuitive RCs to be chosen:
  - Alanine dipeptide: isomerizations as a function of dihedral angles
  - Minimally frustrated protein systems:
    - Q (fraction of native contacts)
    - RMSD (root mean squared deviation) from native state
  - Isocommittor coordinate (also known as: transmission cofficient, the committor, and $P_\text{fold}$)
    - Isocommittor surfaces are hypersurfaces in configuration space thatspan the region between two metastable minima A and B, do not intersect one another, and have the property that trajectories initiated on a given hypersurface have the same probability of reaching state B before state A
    - Transition-state ensemble: the hypersurface in which the value of the isocommittor is 0.5
    - Claim: isocommittor is the best RC for a system with only 2 free energy minima (see: Transition pathways in complex systems: [Reaction coordinates,
isocommittor surfaces, and transition tubes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261405011176))
    - Counterclaim: limited usefulness due to:
      - computational cost,
      - inapplicability if intermediate states present between reactants and products
      - sensitivity to temperature
      - lack of direct relationships to experimental observables
### 3. Path-based methods
#### Transition-path sampling (TPS)
- Random walk in trajectory space to collect a 'transition-path ensemble:' a set of reactive paths
  - Given a set of configurations along a path between two metastable minima A and B, new trajectories can be generated by:
    - Picking a point and shifting it a small amount, then running MD forward and backward until B and A, respectively, are reached
      - Drawbacks:
        - Time for a trajectory to reach one state from another can be prohibitive.
        - Biological systems have multiple metastable minima, with complex pathways between them, rather than just two with a single high barrier
  - Once path sampling data is obtained, reaction coordinates can be computed via Bayesian inference (see [Reaction coordinates and rates from transition paths](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/19/6732))

#### Transition-interface sampling (TIS) and partial path TIS (PPTIS)
- TIS requires an order parameter $\lambda$ to divide the space between reactants and products.
- Rate computation ignores recrosssings, measures 'effective positive flux' through 'hyperplanes'* defined by the order parameter
  - * Potential error? Order parameters that are a linear function of distance from A and B will induce separating hyperplanes in configuration space, but in general they may induce curved separating hypersurfaces
- Avoids the need to simulate full reactive paths, since we only need to compute the steady-state flux of trajectories from a state to its first enclosing interface + between each interface

- [PPTIS](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0310466.pdf) developed for dynamics with high friction or diffusivity: simulations only need to be run between sets of three consecutive interfaces, provides free energy along order parameter at no additional cost

### 4. State-based methods
- Instead of focusing on reaction paths, partition the relevant configurational space into discrete states

#### String methods
- Find reaction paths and rates by construcing a string of configurations along a path connecting reactants and products, then move configurations the configurations toward the minimum energy path
